    <p>  I'm 28, and i'm from northern Virginia. (Fairfax/ prince William) I've done a variety of things for work in the past, from nearly becoming a journeyman HVAC technician (with an AAS in hvac from Northern Virginia Community College), working for dish network as an install technician, to catering weddings, and finally (my current occupation) massage therapy. Well, i've been doing it for about 6.5 years now, i guess I have hit the 10,000 hour mark or so, and can call myself a "master", but I honestly am looking for a change of pace. I consider myself a jack of all trades when it comes to knowledge and work, but my niche is finding something I can enjoy, and prosper doing. Massage just isn't financially the best route to go unless you start your own business. I'd been thinking about computer related classes for a while now, and Lo and behold, up popped the ad for our bootcamp! I am excited and enthused to progress through this class with all of you, and hope it leads us all to greener grass on the other side!</p>
